            Central in the city of Halden, the house of Oscar’s street 1 has
            been a subject of decay. The house has been standing without any

            Once one of the region’s biggest employers, Fredrikstad mekaniske
            verksted was a shipyard building ships and other vessels. In the
            late 80s, the shipyard was closed down and the remaining buildings
            and land was sold off to two different owners. On approximately half
            of the land, time has been standing more or less still the last 40
            years. The old cranes and the broken windows show how the decay has
            been predominant.

            Along the railway through Østfold there is still a few relics from
            the past. Lisleby station is one of them. Even though no train has
            stopped here since 1999, the old station building from 1917 is still
            standing. Challenges with vandalism has been repetitive and the
            neighbours have been complaining. The Norwegian railway authority
            has therefore put up a fence to avoid people going in.
